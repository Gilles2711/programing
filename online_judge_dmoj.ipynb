        "An online judge is a website that contains a repository of programming problems. After selecting a problem, you can submit your solution. The site will test your code. The program is probably correct if your code produces the right answers. Otherwise, more revisions are required if your code has the wrong answers for one or more tests. Here are the benefits of the online judge sites:\n",
        "* Rapid feedback. The site will test your submission with various data and feedback provided as soon as you submit it.\n",
        "* High-quality problems. The online judges' sites have been around for a while now, and most of the problems have been improved over this time.\n",
        "* Quantity of problems. There are many problems available on each site on many different programming concepts.\n",
        "* Community. You can read the comments of others who have tried the problem. Often if you are stuck, there are hints in the comments. Once you have solved a problem, many online judges allow you to see others' submissions. Viewing the code of others is often an excellent way to learn.\n",
